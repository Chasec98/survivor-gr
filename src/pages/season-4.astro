			For Survivor: Dearborn's fourth and final season, we came out swinging. A massive cast of 24 returning players took on the game for the final time in the backyards of Dearborn. They were divided into two tribes based on their previous seasons - the Heroes and Villains. What followed was an epic conclusion to a season three years in the making.
