			<p class="text-center font-fredericka">What's better than three day filmed Survivors? One day drinking Survivors that aren't filmed... probably for the best.</p>
            <p class="text-center font-fredericka">Originating in Oxford, OH, Drinking Survivor quickly became a phenomenon in the Survivor: Dearborn and Grand Rapids community. Alumni were mixed with newbies to play a quick paced one day game of Survivor complete with boozy challenges leading to messy vote outs. Only the best to manage their booze and banter claimed the title and cemented themselves in Survivor lore.</p>
            <p class="text-center font-fredericka">This is their story (from what we remember)</p>
