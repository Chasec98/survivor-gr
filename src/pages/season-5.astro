			After four long years on a hiatus, Survivor returned to Michigan - this time on the West Side of the state. Two former players returned looking to find redemption, while eighteen new castaways entered looking to make their mark on the game. This season upped the game to a level of competitiveness like never before. With riveting gameplay and memorable players, Fresh Meat proudly carries on Dearborn's legacy.
